In procedural programming - which is the way of programming we have been studying so far - a program is divided in to smaller parts, methods. A method works as a separate part of a program and it can be called from anywhere in the program. When a method is called, execution of the program moves to the beginning of the called method. After the execution of the method is done, the program will continue from where the method was called.

In object oriented programming, just like in procedural programming, we attempt to divide a program into smaller parts. In object-oriented programming the small parts are objects. Each separate object has its own individual responsibility; an object contains a related group of information and functionality. Object-oriented programs consist of multiple objects which together define how the program works.
